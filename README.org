I haven't written anything in D, so now I have, and this is that thing
I've written.

It started as a ~"Hello, world"~.

It turned into a toy x86_64 assembler.

Lol.

* Build It

Use any D compiler to compile =main.d=.
#+begin_src sh
  dmd main.d
#+end_src

You can now run it like any other executable.

Linux:
#+begin_src sh
  ./main
#+end_src

Windows:
#+begin_src sh
  main.exe
#+end_src

* Run It

Alternatively, use `rdmd` to run it like a script.
#+begin_src sh
  rdmd main.d
#+end_src
